# üöÄ HackWithInfy‚Äì Day 1

Welcome to **Day 1** of the **Greedy Algorithm Mastery Series**!  
Greedy algorithms make the most optimal choice at each step, hoping that this leads to a globally optimal solution.

This day focuses on foundational greedy problems to get you comfortable with the strategy. Each problem involves making decisions step-by-step to optimize a result.

## üìö Problem List

### 1. üç™ [Assign Cookies](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/description/)  
**Platform:** LeetCode #455  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Concepts:** Sorting, Two Pointer, Greedy Matching  
**Description:**  
Assign cookies to children based on their greed factor such that the maximum number of content children is achieved.  
**Greedy Insight:**  
Sort both the greed and cookie size arrays and try to assign the smallest possible cookie to each child.

### 2. üç´ [Buy Two Chocolates](https://leetcode.com/problems/buy-two-chocolates/)  
**Platform:** LeetCode #2706  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Concepts:** Sorting, Minimum Selection  
**Description:**  
You are given an array of chocolate prices and a certain amount of money. Your task is to buy the two cheapest chocolates and return the money left (or the same amount if not enough).  
**Greedy Insight:**  
Sort the array and always choose the two lowest-priced chocolates.

### 3. üïí [Activity Selection](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/activity-selection-1587115620/)  
**Platform:** GeeksforGeeks  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Concepts:** Interval Scheduling, Greedy by Finish Time  
**Description:**  
You are given `n` activities with start and end times. Select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.  
**Greedy Insight:**  
Sort activities by finish time and always select the next activity whose start time is after or equal to the finish time of the last selected activity.

### 4. üí∞ [Minimum Number of Coins](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/-minimum-number-of-coins4426/)  
**Platform:** GeeksforGeeks  
**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Concepts:** Coin Change, Indian Currency, Greedy  
**Description:**  
Given a value `V`, find the minimum number of Indian coins/notes required to sum up to `V`.  
**Greedy Insight:**  
Start with the largest coin/note and use as many of it as possible before moving to the next smaller denomination.

---

### 5. üîó [Maximum Length of Pair Chain](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-length-of-pair-chain/description/)  
**Platform:** LeetCode #646  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Concepts:** Greedy Chain Building, Sorting by End  
**Description:**  
Given pairs of integers, build the longest chain where each pair `(a, b)` is followed by a pair `(c, d)` such that `b < c`.  
**Greedy Insight:**  
Sort by the second element of the pairs and greedily pick the next non-overlapping pair.

## üß† Key Takeaways

- Greedy algorithms do **not always guarantee** the optimal solution ‚Äî but in these structured problems, they **do** due to the **greedy choice property** and **optimal substructure**.
- Focus on **sorting the input** appropriately and using simple **iterative logic**.
- Ideal problems to master for **coding rounds and interviews**!
